# Overfitting

## What is overfitting

Our goal when creating a model is to be able to use the model to predict outcomes correctly for **new examples**. A model which does this is said to **generalize** well. When a model fits the training data well but does not work well with new examples that are not in the training set, this is overfitting

## How to address overfitting

* Collect more data
* Select features
* Reduce size of parameters ("Regularization")
