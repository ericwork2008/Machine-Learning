# Collaborative filtering

From ChatGPT

**Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique used in machine learning and recommendation systems to predict a user's interests based on past interactions and preferences of similar users**. It operates on the assumption that if two users have agreed on certain items in the past, they are likely to have similar preferences in the future.

#### Types of Collaborative Filtering:

1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   * Finds users with similar preferences and recommends items liked by similar users.
   * Example: If Alice and Bob have rated several movies similarly, then a movie liked by Bob but not yet seen by Alice may be recommended to Alice.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   * Finds items that are similar based on user interactions and recommends similar items.
   * Example: If many users who watched _Movie A_ also watched _Movie B_, then _Movie B_ may be recommended to a user who watched _Movie A_.
3. **Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS):**
   * Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional representations.
   * Used in large-scale applications like Netflix and Spotify.
4. **Deep Learning-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   * Uses neural networks to model complex relationships between users and items.
   * Example: Autoencoders or deep embeddings in recommendation models.

#### Pros and Cons:

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

* Does not require item metadata, only user interaction data.
* Can discover unexpected recommendations.

‚ùå **Challenges:**

* **Cold Start Problem:** Requires enough historical data to be effective.
* **Sparsity:** Many user-item interactions are missing, making predictions difficult.
* **Scalability:** Finding similar users or items in large datasets can be computationally expensive.

Collaborative filtering is widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube for personalized recommendations. Would you like a code example to see it in action? üöÄ
